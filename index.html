      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> Welcome to my personal website! Feel free to explore the site to get to know me and my past experiences. <br><br>    
      I'm an engineer with interests in artifical intelligence, automation, and robotics. 
      I have three years of experience as a Chemical Engineer. During my time, working on automated laboratory and pilot systems at ZwitterCo,
       I developed an interest in programming and its role in making processes across organizations and industries more efficient. This leads me to pursue a Master's in Computer Science at Northeastern University, with hopes to leverage my technical competency and passion for improvement to make meaningful contributions to my community. </p>
