      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hey there, welcome to my personal corner of the web! Take a look around and get to know me better.</p>
      <p>A bit about myself - I grew up in Vietnam before moving to the US to pursue my Bachelor's in 
        Chemical Engineering.  Driven by my passion for environmental causes, I joined ZwitterCo, a promising green tech start-up, after graduation.</p>
      <p>There, I worked on building automated engineering systems for water treatment and discovered my passion for problem-solving 
        and programming. This inspired me to further my studies in computer science at Northeastern, where I have been exploring my 
        interest in Artificial Intelligence and Software Development. Here, I hope to develop my technical and personal skills to create impactful products that address important 
        challenges, especially in sustainability. </p>

      <p>Aside from programming, I also love to cook, go on bike rides, travel, play board games, and practice aerial arts!</p>
