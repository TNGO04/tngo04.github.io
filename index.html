        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my personal website! Feel free to explore the site to get to know me and my past experiences. <br><br>    
        I'm an engineer with interests in artifical intelligence, automation, and robotics. I have three years of experience as a Chemical Engineer, during which I learned programming to help make processes more efficient and automate laboratory testing systems. Recently, I enrolled in the Master's program in Computer Science at Northeastern University with hope to deepen my knowledge and transition to the tech industry. </p>
