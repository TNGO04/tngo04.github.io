                        <h2>Caro</h2>
                        Caro is a logic game similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, but more complex since five-in-a-row is needed to win and the board can be of larger 
                        size (15-by-15). I used OOD concepts to recreate a console-based version of the game, and used minimax algorithms to create an AI player. </div>

                        I created my personal website to practice using foundational web development languages such as CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 
                        I designed the theme myself and built everything from scratch, so even though the website is pretty simple, I am quite proud of it! </div>

                        <h2>Membrane Application Test System</h2>
                        I built several membrane application test systems for ZwitterCo to screen our products' performances and perform continuous testing against potential customer waste streams.
                        This handled all of the company's internal customer testing during our early stages, and was crucial in obtaining ZwitterCo's our first customers and pilot contracts.

                        This is a step up from my previous projects, since I was mostly working with lab-scale system. This system is pilot-scale and can treat up to 300 gallons per day. 
                        I built it and was in charge of various interdisciplinary asks, including procurement, hardware design and assembly, LabVIEW software development, and protocol development.</div>
