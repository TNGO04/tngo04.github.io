                            Tic Tac Toe, with more intricate rules - requiring 5 consecutive moves to win and played on a 20x20 board.</p>
                        <p>In this project, I developed a full-stack web application that enables users to sign up and play against other players or an AI adversary. 
                            The application is built with a three-layer architecture comprising of React.js client, Spring Boot server, and MongoDB database.</p></div>

                        I personally designed the user interface and built the website using fundamental CSS, HTML, and JavaScript without relying on any frameworks.

                        This Java-based application interprets text commands to create basic images using the Java Graphics Library and present them as a dynamic photo album. 
                        The project allowed me to practice using Object-Oriented Design principles and common design patterns to create a Model-View-Controller application with a Java Swing GUI.

                        <h2>Membrane Product Test System</h2>
                        At ZwitterCo, I developed multiple testing systems to assess product performance and continuously test against different wastewater streams. This system handled all internal customer testing during our early stage and played a critical role in securing our first customers and pilot contracts.

                        This project represents a significant step-up from my previous ones as it involved working with a pilot-scale system, capable of treating up to 300 gallons per day. I was responsible for all aspects of the project, including procurement, hardware design and assembly, electrical design, and LabVIEW application development.</div>
