            <p>
                In this project, I built the company's first in-house pilot system. The scale of this project is larger than previous project, as this is similar to a small industrial scale treatment system. 
            </p>

                The system will be shipped in a pallet to pilotting sizes, so there was a limited 40" by 48" footprint to fit all necessary components in. I performed sizing 
                calculations for the piping and pump, and worked with vendors to procure the main components. I designed the equipment layout myself and assemble them on a caster-mount steel deck.

            <p>
                The system uses more devices (including sensors and actuators) than lab-scale systems, so I upgrade to a LabJack device with more capacity. Instead of 
                just controlling actuators that take analog signal, in this project, the LabJack is used in combination with relays to control AC equipment, such as the 
                immersion heater and cooling fan.

                LabVIEW is used to create the HMI and the back-end software that handles I/O, processes and stores data, and perform control logics.
