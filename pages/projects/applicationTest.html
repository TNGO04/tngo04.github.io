        <p>Above are images of two of the 4 application testing systems I built for premilinary testing of customer wastewater at ZwitterCo. </p>

        <img src="/pages/projects/application//P & ID.png">
        <p>
            I started by sketching a simple diagram (called Process and Instrumentation diagram) representing one system and its components, as well as the process 
            flow and how all components are connected/interacted with one another. Based on this diagram, I can organize and figure out what the main equipment and instruments needed for the system, 
            and understand the main requirements of the systems. I then researched on popular vendor websites and procured equipment that fit my criteria and the company's budget.
        </p>

        <img src="/pages/projects/application/cell.png">
        <p>Not all components are procured, such as the membrane testing cell shown above. The membrane is sandwiched between two pieces of the cells, sealed by a custome O-ring (which I lasercut). 
            I custom made the membrane cells using machine shop equipment (CNC mill) since we could not find ready made cells with reasonable costs and approriate design.</p>

        <img src="/pages/projects/application/LabJack.png">
        <p> The system is designed to be able to run unsupervised overnight, so it is almost fully automated and controlable remotely. We used a LabJack device for data acquisition and control by dealing with inputs from sensors and outputs to actuated devices. </p>
        
        <img src="/pages/projects/application/HMI.png">
        <p> LabVIEW is a systems engineering software that can be used for industrial and laboratory automation. In this project, LabVIEW was used to create the front-end aspect (HMI to interact with users and display data) and the back-end 
            (communicating with LabJack for I/O, data analysis and storage, signal processing, controls logic, exception handling). </p>
            <img src="/pages/projects/application/block-diagram.png">
            <p> It was difficult at first since as a Chemical Engineer, I did not have much experiences in LabVIEW, and it is a graphical programming interface so I was not as familiar with it since I have mostly coded only in C++ and Python before.
            However, National Instruments provide pretty good documentation and tutorials online for me to self-learn how to program an automated system. In addition, by breaking down a large automation software into many small tasks to be achieved, the project was much less daunting, and I was able to successfully build the software for data acquisition, analysis, and automation.
