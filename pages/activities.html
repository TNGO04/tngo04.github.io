                <h1>Aerial Arts</h1>
                <p>I began training in Aerial Arts September of 2021 and fell in love due to its unique combination of athleticity and artistry. I also admire how training in aerial arts has helped me realized the strength and mobility I did not know exist in my body, and I truly believe aerial arts are for everyone, regardless of body size or fitness level. </p> 
                <p>I started off with pole and have since picked up Lyra (Hoop) and Sling (Aerial Hammock). When not working on improving my programming skill, you can find me training at Fly Together Fitness and ESH Circus Arts in Somerville, MA. I have also trained at LYS Studio and Foenix Studio in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</p>

                <h1>Traveling</h1>
                <p>Originally from Vietnam, I have had the opportunities to travel a lot in East and Southeast Asia. I also have travelled a lot in the U.S. during my time living here. I love travelling and exploring nature, cuisines, and arts from different regions.</p>

                <p>I discovered tabletop gaming during my first year at college and took to it immediately. As an engineer at heart who loves solving puzzles, board games provide perfect opportunities to engage in problem-solving while being part of a community full of like-minded geeks. </p>
                <p>My favorite games are Coup, Betrayal of House on the Hill, and Terraforming Mars!</p>
