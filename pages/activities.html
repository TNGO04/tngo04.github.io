                <h1>Aerial Arts</h1>
                <p>I began training in Aerial Arts September of 2021 and fell in love due to its unique combination of athleticity and artistry. I also admire how training in aerial arts has helped me realized the strength and mobility I did not know exist in my body, and I truly believe aerial arts are for everyone, regardless of body size or fitness level. </p> 
                <p>I started off with pole and have since picked up Lyra (Hoop) and Sling (Aerial Hammock). When not working on improving my programming skill, you can find me training at Fly Together Fitness and ESH Circus Arts in Somerville, MA. I have also trained at LYS Studio and Foenix Studio in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.</p>

            <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
            <p> Graphic Design is a hobby/skill I picked up during high school. I love to communicate through visual objects, and graphic design is the perfect tool for that. </p>
            <p> My tools of choice are Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I utilised these skills in creating graphic arts of my own (like the stamp collection shown here) and designing promotional materials for on-campus organizations that I was a part of. </p>

                <h1>Traveling</h1>
                <p>Originally from Vietnam, I have had the opportunities to travel a lot in East and Southeast Asia. I also have travelled a lot in the U.S. during my time living here. I love exploring nature, trying local cuisines, and discovering arts from different regions.</p>

                <p>I discovered tabletop gaming during my first year at college and took to it immediately. As an engineer at heart who loves solving puzzles, board games provide perfect opportunities to engage in problem-solving while being part of a community full of like-minded geeks. I found that programming offers similar qualities to tabletop gaming that I felt in love with: logical reasoning and problem-solving.</p>
                <p>At Tufts University, I was co-president of Tufts Tabletop Gaming Club, working towards expanding club membership, creating a sense of inclusitivity, and inviting all types of gamers to join weekly game sessions. My favorite games are Coup, Betrayal of House on the Hill, and Terraforming Mars!</p>
